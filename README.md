# Loan Default Prediction Project
Lending Club is a company based in San Francisco that operates the world’s largest online peer-to-peer lending platform. It allows borrowers to create online loan listings, which investors can browse. Using information provided about the borrower and loan conditions, investors can select loan(s) to fund.

Whilst it can be a good investment option, lending money through Lending Club can be understandably daunting for members of the public. As such, a predictive model that can accurately predict whether borrowers will pay back their loans would be a useful tool when choosing which loan(s) to fund, if any. 

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning techniques to build a model to predict whether or not a loan will be paid back in full. Data on all of Lending Club’s approved loans from 2007-2011 was used for this project, which can be found on their website: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action
